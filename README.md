# Assignment 5.1: Will a Customer Accept the Coupon?
 
## Overview
In this project, we look at Amazon Mechanical Turk survey data that comes to us via the UCI Machine Learning repository. A coupon is delivered to the cell phones of drivers when they are in the vicinity of a restaurant, and the data records their response: if they accepted to use it right away, save it for a later date or declined the coupon. Additionally, we have access to a variety of other information such as personal and demographic information of the driver, type of coupon, weather, destination, and so on. Our goal here was to use our current knowledge of plotting and visualizations to highlight differences between who did or did not accept a coupon offering.
